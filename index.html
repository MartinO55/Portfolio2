                  "Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Martin and I am
                  an aspiring web developer and software engineer, chasing my
                  passion for design, coding and software development. I have a
                  wide variety of experience in many different subjects and a
                  proven track record of academic achievement in a wide variety
                  of fields, including cybersecurity and fullstack web
                  development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the last two years I have been working at the department
                  of Customer Service in the NSW Government, specifically with
                  GTP (Government Technology Platforms). As part of the team at
                  GTP, I have been working on the CCE project which allows NSW
                  Government Agencies to manage their entire complaint response
                  and licencing programs in a single application!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout my career, I've worked on a variety of projects,
                  from small business websites to large-scale enterprise
                  software. I have a passion for creating high-quality,
                  user-friendly, and efficient solutions that meet my clients'
                  needs and exceed their expectations. In addition to my
                  technical skills, I'm also a great communicator and
                  problem-solver, and I enjoy working with clients to understand
                  their goals and challenges and coming up with creative
                  solutions to help them achieve success.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I'm not coding, you can find me painting, cooking,
                  downhill skiing or doing tabletop gaming.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio. If
                  you have any questions or would like to discuss a potential
                  project, please don't hesitate to contact me."

                  This was the first game I built and published with the Unity
                  Engine (and it shows), with the goal of gaining some
                  experience with as much of the game development pipeline as
                  possible. I did all of the programming, 3D modelling, rigging
                  and animating myself; in fact the only thing I didn't do was
                  the sound composition! Unfortunately, this was before I
                  discovered Git and github, so there is no history or source
                  code available, but I have uploaded the completed .apk file to
                  github for you to download. It should run on any android
                  device.

                  Here is a version of Minesweeper I made in Java for the
                  Command Line. 100% made in java without addons... it's
                  basically Minesweeper, but this was the first complete java
                  application I made.
